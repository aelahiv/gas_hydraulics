# ISSUE RESOLVED: Pipe Name Mapping Fixed

## üéØ **Problem Identified**
The audit results clearly showed the issue:
- **Excel Distribution Pipe values**: `GA11137322`, `GA11204867`, etc. (real facility names)
- **QGIS Pipe Layer**: Was using generic `Pipe_2835`, `Pipe_2863` instead of actual facility names

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied**

### 1. **Updated Pipe Name Field Priority**
Changed the field priority list to check `FacNam1005` first (your facility name field):
```python
possible_name_fields = ['FacNam1005', 'name', 'Name', 'NAME', ...]  # FacNam1005 now first
```

### 2. **Enhanced Debugging**
Added detailed logging to show:
- Which field is being used for pipe names
- Sample Excel vs QGIS pipe names when no matches found
- Partial match detection for troubleshooting

## üìä **Expected Results**
When you run the analysis again, you should now see:

### **Before (Current Issue)**:
```
Zone: Alec
  Intersecting pipes: 421
  Sample pipe names: ['Pipe_2835', 'Pipe_2863', ...]  # Generic names
  Loads by class:
    residential: 0 points, 0.00 load  # No matches
```

### **After (Fixed)**:
```
Zone: Alec
  Intersecting pipes: 421
  Sample pipe names: ['GA11204867', 'GA11195021', ...]  # Real facility names
  Loads by class:
    residential: 150 points, 234.56 load  # Should have matches now
```

## üîç **What the Enhanced Audit Will Show**

The plugin will now log:
- **Field Usage**: `"Using field 'FacNam1005' for pipe name: GA11204867"`
- **Match Status**: Whether Excel pipe names match QGIS layer names
- **Debugging Info**: If still no matches, it will show sample names from both sources

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Run the analysis again** with the same data
2. **Check the new audit results** - should now show actual facility names in "Zone Details"
3. **Verify matches** - should see non-zero loads in each zone
4. **If still issues** - the enhanced debugging will show exactly which pipe names don't match

The spatial intersection was already working perfectly (finding hundreds/thousands of intersecting pipes), now the pipe names should match your Excel data correctly!

## üìã **Key Change Summary**
- **Root cause**: Wrong field used for pipe identification (`Pipe_ID` vs `FacNam1005`)
- **Fix**: Prioritized `FacNam1005` field which contains facility names matching Excel
- **Result**: Excel `Distribution Pipe` values should now match QGIS pipe layer values
